To view the html code, right cick anywhere on the screen and choose the Inspect Element option in a browser with developer tools. From there you can view the structure of the html including the semantic elements. To view the alt text, inspect the image elements and observe the 'alt=' attribute in the dev tools. The updated page title can be viewed by oberving the page or tab title when the webpage is open.
